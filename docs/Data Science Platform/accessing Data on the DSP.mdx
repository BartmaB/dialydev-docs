# Accessing Data on the DSP

The DSP allows users to access data from external sources such as on-prem databases or the Enterprise Data Lake.

## Requesting Data from the EDL

## Connecting an on-prem DB

> Note: When requesting data it is important not to copy it directly into a DSPs SQL Database since this is not what a DSP env is built for and it could drastically increase costs. It is recommended to implement logic in Databricks to process the data before storing it in DSP DBs.

Due to the BASFs strategy of moving all data to the cloud, users are disencouraged to use on-prem storage solutions.

## Storing large amounts of Data in the Cloud

ADLS v2 storage containers are a multi purpose storage solution meant for (but not limited to) the following cases:

- To persist calculations done within the DSP env.
- To store data that you get directly from an external source [Through Azure Data Factory]
- To store files you might upload manually
- etc...
