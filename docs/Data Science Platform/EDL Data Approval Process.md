# EDL Data Approval Process


Lab Owners who order a Data Science Platform and would like to work with EDL data have to read and accept their rights and duties when working with the data.

Please read the latest version of the EDL Data Approval Process and reach out to the Data Steward or EDL Team for questions.

## Summary of the most important points:

- Data or Application Owner of systems connected to EDL agree that data in EDL is shared with its consumers. Certain data can only be shared under dedicated conditions.
- Lab Owner or Lab Assistant is fully accountable for data sharing inside their DSP/external environment.
- Lab Owner or Lab Assistant is the only one who is authorized to raise a request for Data via the BASF Data Catalog.
- Lab Owner or Lab Assistant is responsible to ensure that no strictly confidential data is requested via Ingestion Request to the EDL team.
- Lab Owner or Lab Assistants can inform themselves in the BASF Data Catalog about restrictions regarding classified data (e.g., PII, or other critical data). If classification-relevant information is missing, it is recommended to consult the Application or Data Owner. The Data Stewards will support in the documentation-process or Data Privacy in general.
- The access to data might be revoked or restricted based on Data Classifications. These Classifications can become effective even after a Data Consumer got access to a dataset of EDL.

## Data Approvals (please note that this is a temporary process)

If new tables need to be replicated into EDL, the source owner needs to approve that request first.

### To whom do I need to reach out?

- Cobalt Z2L: Malte Peter malte.peter@basf.com; Ekkehard Matke ekkehard.matke@basf.com
- Mabas ZD4: Rene Boehme rene.boehme@basf.com
- APO Z7C: Christian Ehmann christian.ehmann@basf.com
- Cobus: Christian Kaelcke christian.kaelcke@basf.com
- GTS BGP: Christine Mueller christine.mueller@basf.com
- Condor: Angelika Ruhe angelika.ruhe@basf.com

### What information do I need to provide?

- System and table that needs to be replicated.
- Where does that table need to be replicated to?
- Who is the requestor and use case behind?
- What is the benefit of having data from that table?

### How do I get approval?

- There is no formal template needed as of now.
- Reach out to the approver via mail and provide necessary information.
- When approval is given, you can reach out with the approval to DIL / EDL.

### What do I need to do with the approval?

Reply to the request you got in service4you portal and attach the email with the approval you have received.

### Please consider:

- New Data ingestion requests and existing datasets in EDL are classified as Confidential and Lab Owners / Requestors need ensure that no Strictly Confidential data is included.
- Strictly Confidential data is not allowed in EDL at the moment (August 2022) but we are working on it.
- Lab Owner needs to get a separate approval for GDPR Data by Data Protection Officer.
- EDL Team does only technical implementation of data requests.
- The EDL Team reserves the right to remove data immediately, if Lab Owner does not follow above mentioned rules. This could lead into a non-working lab logic.
