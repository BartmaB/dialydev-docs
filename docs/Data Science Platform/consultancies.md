# Consultancies

Working on a Big Data Project requires a special set of skills and know-how. Teams in BASF willing to start a PoC, project or an application in the DSP environment may find themselves in 2 camps:

1. Those new to the DSP environment and with limited know-how on the best practices on how to create data pipelines and application within the Azure environment.
2. Existing DSP labs that wish to improve existing processes or wish to develop new projects within a set of specifications.

For these users, it is recommended to contact the Analytics Enablement (AE) team to address their consultancy's needs.
