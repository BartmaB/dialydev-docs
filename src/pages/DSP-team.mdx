# DSP-team

Welcome to the Data Science Platform. The Azure cloud based environment for Big Data, Machine Learning and Business Intelligence. This document serves to grant a general overview of the DSP product, its included services, pricing tiers and surrounding team - Data and Analytics DnA. The DSP as a product can be seen as a spinoff of the Enterprise Data Lake and the concept of the old EDL lab can be considered as its first prototype. The DSP has been specifically designed and built around our users requirements in order to fulfill our customers' needs.

The Data Science Platform is a secure cloud environment to work and create value out of large amounts of data. Each environment can request and access tables ingested from and hosted on a common data lake storage, the Enterprise Data Lake. Additionally, it is possible for our users to eventually ingest data independently if that is necessary. Each Environment has a set of PaaS  technologies which are meant to enable a developer to work on data. Additionally, the DSP is connected to a shared Azure Devops project where through tools such as repositories, Azure Pipelines is possible to follow DevOps best practices in order to be able to create robust applications.
